Alright, I'm looking at this chess problem. The user provided a FEN and an ASCII representation of a chessboard. They want me to figure out what changed since the last position, who made the last move, what's new in the position, if any new pieces are attacked, the biggest threat, and how to respond.

First, I'll compare the given FEN with the standard starting position. The FEN is rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1. Comparing that to the initial FEN, which is similar but has all pawns on their starting squares.

Looking at the board, I notice a white pawn on e5 (from the 4P3 part) and a missing pawn in the third rank for black's pawns. So, someone must have moved a pawn forward from e2 to e5. That’s an unusual move because pawns don't usually go three squares at once unless it's their first move.

Since the current player is black (as indicated by 'b' in FEN), the last move was made by white. White likely advanced the e-pawn from e2 to e5, which skips over e3 and e4, something only possible on its first move.

Now, what's new? The e5 pawn is a key change. It controls squares d6 and f6, which are now under attack. So, any pieces on those squares would be in danger if they were there, but currently, they're empty.

Are any new pieces attacked? Black has a queen (Q) on d8, but the e5 pawn doesn't directly attack it. However, the pawn's presence might influence future moves or put pressure on black to respond.

The biggest threat here is the advanced white pawn on e5. It's strong because it can control key central squares and could potentially create a passed pawn if not contained. Plus, it opens lines for other pieces like the bishop or queen to come into play.

How should black respond? They need to challenge the e5 pawn before it becomes too powerful. The best move is probably f6, challenging the pawn's hold on the center and preparing for an exchange if white takes. Alternatively, developing a piece with something like ...Nf6 could be good as well, setting up for other moves while addressing the threat.

I should structure my response to clearly address each of these points step by step, making sure it’s easy to follow.

Let's analyze the chess position and answer your questions step by step:

---

### **1. What changed since the last position?**

- The white pawn on e5 (`4P3`) has moved forward from its starting position at e2. This is a significant move because it skips over the squares e3 and e4, which is only possible if this is the pawn's first move.
- In the ASCII representation, you can see that there is now a white pawn on e5, while the corresponding black pawn on e7 has been removed from its starting position. This indicates that the last move was likely **e2-e5**.

---

### **2. Who made the last move, us or them?**

- The current player to move is Black (indicated by `b` in the FEN string). Therefore, the last move was made by White.

---

### **3. What is new in the position?**

- A white pawn has advanced to e5 (`4P3`), which is an unusual and aggressive first move.
- This creates a strong presence in the center of the board for White, potentially preparing for further expansion or tactical ideas.

### **4. Are any new pieces attacked?**

- The white pawn on e5 attacks two squares: d6 and

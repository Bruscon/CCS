Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this chess analysis task. The user wants me to create a prompt that will analyze each move from a FEN string and answer five specific questions concisely. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the setup: after each move, I'll receive two FEN stringsâ€”the current board position and the previous one. My job is to generate a prompt that will analyze these positions and answer the questions. The user provided an example of how this should look, so I can model my response similarly.

The five questions are:
1. What piece was moved?
2. Was it a capture?
3. What's the evaluation score? (e.g., +0.5, -1.0)
4. Is there any tactical threat or forced variation?
5. Any other notable observations?

I need to make sure each answer is very concise, so probably just one word or a short phrase for each.

Let me think about how I can structure this prompt. It needs to take the FEN strings as input and then process them through an analysis tool, likely using chess engines like Stockfish to evaluate the positions. The evaluation score will help determine the strength of each position, which is essential for answering question 3.

For the first question, identifying the moved piece requires comparing the two FEN strings. The difference between them should show which piece was moved from where to where. This might involve checking the board state before and after the move to see what changed.

Determining if it's a capture (question 2) would involve looking at whether the destination square in the current FEN has an opposing piece that wasn't there in the previous position. If so, then it was a capture; otherwise, not.

The evaluation score comes from running an analysis on the current board position. Chess engines can provide this quickly, giving me the necessary numerical value to answer question 3.

For question 4 about tactical threats or forced variations, I need to check if there are any immediate checks, captures, or discovered attacks that could force a response from the opponent. This might involve looking for forks, pins, or other tactical motifs in the current position.

Lastly, any notable observations (question 5) should highlight interesting aspects like king safety, pawn structure changes, potential for castling, or any significant positional advantages that arise from the move.

I should make sure each part of the prompt is clear and structured so that when processed, it can efficiently answer all five questions without unnecessary verbosity. Testing this with a sample FEN string would help ensure it's working as intended.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this chess problem. The user is providing two FEN positions and a series of questions after each move. My task is to analyze the move made between the previous and current board positions and answer those five specific questions concisely.

First, I need to understand what each FEN position represents. FEN stands for Forsyth-Edwards Notation, which is a way to describe a particular board position in chess. It includes information about piece placement, whose turn it is, castling rights, en passant squares, and the halfmove clock and fullmove number.

Looking at the example provided:

Current board position: 8/8/2p5/pP3p2/P3P3/2N5/6PP/4RK1 w - - 0 1

Previous board position: 8/8/2p5/2p3p2/P3P3/2N5/6PP/4RK1 w - - 0 1

So, comparing these two FEN strings, I need to determine what move was made. Let's break down the differences:

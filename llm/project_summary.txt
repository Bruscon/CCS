The project is a chess GUI application built in Python using tkinter, with the code organized into four main files:

board_state.py: Handles all chess game logic including:

Move validation and execution
Game state tracking
Square control calculation
Move history and undo functionality


file_manager.py: Manages all file operations including:

Saving/loading game positions in JSON format
Managing directory structure
Session archiving
Position history cleanup


chess_gui.py: Handles visualization and user interaction with:

Interactive chess board with click-to-move interface
Square control visualization (colors showing piece influence)
Move highlighting
Status updates and game info display
Control panel with buttons for new game, undo, and save position


main.py: Application entry point providing:

Command-line argument parsing (log level, theme selection)
Logging configuration
Window management
Component initialization and coordination



Key Features:

Visual square control system showing which squares are attacked by which side
Position saving after each move
Undo move functionality
Multiple color themes
Session logging
Error handling and recovery
Auto-archiving of game sessions

The application uses:

python-chess for core chess logic
tkinter for the GUI
Standard library components for file operations
Logging for debugging and error tracking

The code follows object-oriented principles with clean separation of concerns, making it easy to extend with new features.

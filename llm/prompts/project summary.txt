This is a chess GUI application built with Python, combining python-chess for game logic and tkinter for the interface. The key components are:

Core Files:

chess_gui.py: Main GUI class implementing the chess interface
top.py: Entry point handling program initialization and move processing

Key Features:

Interactive chess board with click-to-move functionality
Square control visualization system that colors squares based on which pieces attack them
Position saving after moves
Move processing queue system

Implementation Details to Note:


Uses tkinter's after() mechanism for periodic updates
Implements square control visualization using python-chess's attackers() method
Saves board positions and FEN strings after each move
Handles move processing using a combination of threads and event queue
